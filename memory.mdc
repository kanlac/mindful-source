## Code philosophy
- Eliminating edge cases is always better than adding conditional judgments. "If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program."
- Prefer `switch` over `if`

## File Naming Convention
- Use simple names like `service/user.go` instead of `service/user_service.go`

## Model Definition
- Prefer value over pointer for clean code. If backward compatibility is required, use a partial unique index that only applies to non-empty keys

## How to Run Tests
- Prefer running single tests instead of package test for performance.

## How to Write Golang Tests
- When write test files, ALWAYS use `*_test.go` naming convention
- Prefer table-driven tests

## Tool Usage
- Always use `resolve-library-id` to get official documentation for any libraries or frameworks mentioned in requirements
- Consult official docs before making implementation decisions
- Verify API contracts and usage patterns from authoritative sources

## Documenting
- When changed API endpoint param/resp, ALWAYS update Swagger comment if it exist.

## Workflow
- Never `git commit` unless I asked for it
